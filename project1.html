        <p>This project was developed in collaboration with a team for the Welland Minor Baseball League to streamline league management and improve user experience for coaches, parents, and players.
            The project helped me to get a deeper understanding of data structures, front-end and back-end development using different programming languages to build and application applications that solves the needs of the client.
            My primary role in this project was contributing to the design and development of the web application, ensuring it was both functional and easy to navigate.
